<h2>Q&A</h2>

<FaqDetail question="I see a game I gave you on the list! What the hell?!">
  <p>
    It's probably a duplicate. I am so fortunate to have people in my life who know that unwrapping
    a new board game is a joy I cherish above all others, and as I don't keep a public list of games
    somewhere, duplicates were inevitable. But fear not! I'm only giving away <em>someone else's</em
    > copy, not yours, the one that I love and treasure.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've also had the pleasure to play many of these extensively at a different time in my life, and
    I'm hoping they can bring other gamers as much joy as they've brought me over the years.

<FaqDetail question="Why are you downsizing now?">
  <p>
    Do you see how many games are on this list? The list of games I'm giving away? This isn't half
    of the games I have. I live in a warehouse. And if I don't do it soon, I'm going to be living in
    a warehouse <em>alone</em>.

<FaqDetail question="Why do you have so many unopened games?">
  <p>
    That's a rude thing to ask an American; everyone knows the important thing is Having More
    Stuff&trade;, rather than enjoying what you already have.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just kidding, the issue was mostly optimism. A genuine hope that adults with busy lives would
    have endless time to try new games, and a willing imagination that fed me image after image of a
    happy brunch & board games for each shrink-wrapped box.
  </p>
  <p>
    There may also have been one or two purchases appended to reach free shipping thresholds. Hey, I
    already admitted I was American.

<FaqDetail question="Are the opened games in good condition?">
  <p>
    I am pretty protective about my games, and I would feel comfortable saying most of them are
    "like new." Some of the ones that have been played more may show a little wear, though nothing
    that would make the game unplayable or unsightly. Plus, it's hard to beat the low price of free.

<FaqDetail question="I don't live in Austin. Will you ship it to me?">
  <p>If you don't mind Venmoing me the shipping, I'll gladly put it in a box with an address.</p>
</FaqDetail>

<FaqDetail question="Seems like it might not arrive before &lt;NEXT_BIG_HOLIDAY&gt;">
  <p>
    That's hardly the only occasion to give someone a giftâ€”the results can be even better when
    they're not expecting it. But if you need a solution for right now, you could always wrap an
    index card or a Post-It "coupon," and let the recipient know that Santa's elves are not beyond
    the reach of global shipping delays.

<FaqDetail
  question="I've got some games I'd like to offer/donate as well. Can I add them to your list?"
>
  <p>Sure! Message me.</p>
</FaqDetail>

<FaqDetail question="Can I forward this list to other people?">
  <p>
    Yes, but I am very inured to messages from outside my contact list, so I can't promise I won't
    miss something if I don't know it's coming.
