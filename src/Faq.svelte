  <summary>I see a game I gave you on the list! What the hell?!</summary>
  <div class="details-inner">
    <p>
      It's probably a duplicate. I am so fortunate to have people in my life who know that
      unwrapping a new board game is a joy I cherish above all others, and as I don't keep a public
      list of games somewhere, duplicates were inevitable. But fear not! I'm only giving away <em
        >someone else's</em
      > copy, not yours, the one that I love and treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've also had the pleasure to play many of these extensively at a different time in my life,
      and I'm hoping they can bring other gamers as much joy as they've brought me over the years.

  <summary>Why are you downsizing now?</summary>
  <div class="details-inner">
    <p>
      Do you see how many games are on this list? The list of games I'm giving away? This isn't half
      of the games I have. I live in a warehouse. And if I don't do it soon, I'm going to be living
      in a warehouse <em>alone</em>.

  <summary>Why do you have so many unopened games?</summary>
  <div class="details-inner">
    <p>
      That's a rude thing to ask an American; everyone knows the important thing is Having More
      Stuff&trade;, rather than enjoying what you already have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just kidding, the issue was mostly optimism. A genuine hope that adults with busy lives would
      have endless time to try new games, and a willing imagination that fed me image after image of
      a happy brunch & board games for each shrink-wrapped box.
    </p>
    <p>
      There may also have been one or two purchases appended to reach free shipping thresholds. Hey,
      I already admitted I was American.

  <summary>Are the opened games in good condition?</summary>
  <div class="details-inner">
    <p>
      I am pretty protective about my games, but the ones that have been played more may show a
      little wear and tear. Nothing that would make the game unplayable or unsightly. Plus, it's
      hard to beat the low price of free.

  <summary>I don't live in Austin. Will you ship it to me?</summary>
  <div class="details-inner">
    <p>If you don't mind Venmoing me the shipping, I'll gladly put it in a box with an address.</p>

  <summary>Seems like it might not arrive before &lt;NEXT_BIG_HOLIDAY&gt;</summary>

      That's hardly the only occasion to give someone a giftâ€”the results can be even better when
      they're not expecting it. But if you need a solution for right now, you could always wrap an
      index card or a Post-It "coupon," and let the recipient know that Santa's elves are not beyond
      the reach of global shipping delays.

  <summary>Can I forward this list to other people?</summary>
  <div class="details-inner">
    <p>
      Yes, but I am very inured to messages from outside my contact list, so I can't promise I won't
      miss something if I don't know it's coming.
